This is the code for the web application made for the purpose of research into Open Data, Serious Games, Gamified Learning and Gamification.
The game is modelled in the form of the popular 'Top Trumps' cards game, but in this version, the user is playing against the computer in order to win. Helpful quotations are provided after every round in order to help cement the learning process, and the game ends after a four point lead is attained by either combatant.
This game is not optimized for mobiles or tablets. This is meant to be played on a PC or laptop, due to the nature of the research.
